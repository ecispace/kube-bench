          Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and
          if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.
          Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the
          clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role :
          kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

          Seccomp目前是一个alpha功能。 默认情况下，禁用所有Alpha功能。 因此，您需要通过传递"--featuregates=AllAlpha=true"参数来启用apiserver中的alpha功能。
          Edit the /etc/kubernetes/apiserver file on the master node and set the KUBE_API_ARGS
          parameter to "--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
          KUBE_API_ARGS="--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true"
          根据您的系统，重新启动kube-apiserver服务。 例如：
          systemctl restart kube-apiserver.service
          使用注释在pod定义中启用docker/default seccomp配置文件。 一个例子如下：
          apiVersion: v1
